# RolyPoly

RolyPoly is an RNA virus analysis toolkit, including a variety of commands and wrappers for external tools (from raw read processing to genome annotation). It also includes an "end-2-end" command that employs an entire pipeline.   
For more detailed information, please refer to the [docs](https://pages.jgi.doe.gov/uneri/rolypoly/).

## Installation

There are several ways to install RolyPoly:

### Option 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)

<details><summary>The fastest way to get started. Downloads and installs everything automatically, including mamba if needed.</summary>

```bash
curl -O https://code.jgi.doe.gov/UNeri/rolypoly/-/raw/main/src/rolypoly/utils/quick_setup.sh && \
bash quick_setup.sh
```

Or with custom paths:
```bash
bash quick_setup.sh /path/to/conda/env /path/to/install/rolypoly_code /path/to/store/databases /path/to/logfile
```
  
*The logfile will be saved to the path you provide, or to `~/RolyPoly_quick_setup.log` if you don't provide a path.
</details>

### Option 2: Manual Installation with Custom Data Directory

<details><summary>Install RolyPoly but specify where to store the external databases</summary>

```bash
git clone https://code.jgi.doe.gov/UNeri/rolypoly.git
cd rolypoly
mamba create -n rolypoly -f misc/env_files/env_big.yaml 
mamba activate rolypoly
pip install . # Use pip install -e .[dev] for development installation
rolypoly prepare-external-data --data_dir /path/to/data/dir
conda env config vars set ROLYPOLY_DATA=$ROLYPOLY_DATA
```
</details>

### Option 3: Minimal Installation

<details><summary>Create smaller conda environments, each containing dependencies for specific commands.</summary>

```bash
mamba create -n rolypoly_filter_reads -f misc/env_files/filter_reads.yaml
mamba create -n rolypoly_assembly -f misc/env_files/assembly.yaml
mamba create -n rolypoly_annotation -f misc/env_files/annotation.yaml 
mamba create -n rolypoly_rdrp -f misc/env_files/marker_searchyaml 
mamba activate rolypoly_<command_name>
pip install .
rolypoly prepare-external-data
```
</details>

## Usage
RolyPoly is a command-line tool with subcommands for different stages of the RNA virus identification pipeline. For a detailed help (in terminal), use `rolypoly help`. For more specific help, see the [docs](./docs/mkdocs_docs/commands/index.md).

```bash
rolypoly [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
 ```

## Dependencies
<details><summary>Click to show dependencies</summary>

By default, the ["quick_setup.sh"](./misc/quick_setup.sh) option will install all of these with mamba/conda or pip. If you are curios or prefer to install them/get the binaries alternatively, see the [setup*.py scripts](/misc/). Not all commands require all the dependencies, hence we made some slimmer conda environments for specific purposes - but that is not recommended.

## Motivation
Current workflows for RNA virus detection are functional but could be improved, especially by utilizing raw reads instead of pre-existing, general-purpose made, assemblies. Here we proceed with more specific processes tailored for RNA viruses.

Several similar software exist, but have different uses, for example:  
- hecatomb ([github.com/shandley/hecatomb](https://github.com/shandley/hecatomb)): uses mmseqs for homology detection and thus is less sensitive than the additional HMMer based identification herein.
- AliMarko ([biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.19.603887](https://biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.19.603887)): Utilizes a single-sample assembly only approach, not supporting co/cross assembly of multiple samples. Additionally, AliMarko uses a small, partially outdated (IMO) HMM profile set.

### Reporting Issues
For issues or suggestions, please open an issue on the [Issues](https://code.jgi.doe.gov/UNeri/rolypoly/-/issues) page.  
If possible, please provide the exact way you called rolypoly (command and location), as well as a log file (if generated) and other potential details (e.g. for the read-filtering step, the config file  `run_info/config.json` generated).
