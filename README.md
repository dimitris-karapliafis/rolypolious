# RolyPoly

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/rolypoly-tk.svg?cacheSeconds=300)](https://pypi.org/project/rolypoly-tk/) [![Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/rolypoly-tk.svg?cacheSeconds=300)](https://pypi.org/project/rolypoly-tk/) [![PyPI Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/rolypoly-tk?period=monthly&units=INTERNATIONAL_SYSTEM&left_color=BLACK&right_color=GREEN&left_text=Downloads+%28month%29)](https://pepy.tech/projects/rolypoly-tk) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/UriNeri/rolypoly.svg)](LICENSE) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-urineri.github.io%2Frolypoly-blue)](https://urineri.github.io/rolypoly/)

RolyPoly is an RNA virus analysis toolkit, meant to be a "swiss-army knife" for RNA virus discovery and characterization by including a variety of commands, wrappers, parsers, automations, and some "quality of life" features for any many of a virus investigation process (from raw read processing to genome annotation). While it includes an "end-2-end" command that employs an entire pipeline, the main goals of rolypoly are:
- Help non-computational researchers take a deep dive into their data without compromising on using tools that are non-techie friendly.  
- Help (software) developers of virus analysis pipeline "plug" holes missing from their framework, by using specific RolyPoly commands to add features to their existing code base.

## Note - Rolypoly is still under development (contributions welcome!)
RolyPoly is an open, still in progress project - I aim to summarise the main functionality into a manuscript ~mid 2026. Pull requests and contributions are welcome and will be considered (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).  
This also means that there are bugs, verbose logging even for non debug mode, and some place holders and TODOs here and there.

## Installation

### Quick and Easy - One Conda/Mamba Environment
**Recommended for most users** who want a "just works" solution and primarily intend to use rolypoly as a CLI tool in an independent environment.

We hope to have rolypoly available from bioconda in the near future.  
In the meantime, it can be installed with the [`quick_setup.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UriNeri/rolypoly/main/src/setup/quick_setup.sh) script, which is Conda/Mamba-based (uses `mamba` or `micromamba`) and also fetches the pre-generated data rolypoly requires.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UriNeri/rolypoly/main/src/setup/quick_setup.sh && \
bash quick_setup.sh 
```

#### Quick Setup - Additional Options
You can specify custom paths for the code, databases, and Conda/Mamba environment location (this is also how you "name" the environment by choosing its path):
```bash
bash quick_setup.sh /path/to/conda/env /path/to/install/rolypoly_code /path/to/store/databases /path/to/logfile
```
Example with an explicit environment path:
```bash
bash quick_setup.sh "$HOME/mamba_envs/rolypoly"
```
By default if no positional arguments are supplied, rolypoly is installed into the session current folder (path the quick_setup.sh is called from):   
- database in `./rolypoly/data/`  
- code in `./rolypoly/code/ `  
- conda environment in `./rolypoly/env/`  
- log file in `./rolypoly/RolyPoly_quick_setup.log`   



### Modular / Dev - Command-Specific Pixi Environments
**For software developers** looking to try or make use of specific rolypoly features with minimal risk of dependency conflicts. This approach should allow you to install only the tools you need for specific functionality. Note: dependencies from pip are always installed; conda/bioconda dependencies are the modular ones.

```bash
# Install pixi first (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/UriNeri/rolypoly.git
cd rolypoly

# Install for specific functionality (examples):
pixi install -e reads-only        # Just read processing tools
pixi install -e assembly-only     # Just assembly tools  
pixi install -e basic-analysis    # Reads + assembly + identification
pixi install -e complete          # All tools (equivalent to legacy install)

# Run commands in the appropriate environment
pixi run -e reads-only rolypoly filter-reads --help
# or load the environment
pixi shell -e reads-only
rolypoly filter-reads --help
```  
For detailed modular installation options, see the [installation documentation](https://urineri.github.io/rolypoly/installation).

## Usage
RolyPoly is a command-line tool with subcommands grouped by analysis stage. 
Use `rolypoly --help` or `rolypoly <command> --help` for most up to date details. Some additional information is in the [docs](https://urineri.github.io/rolypoly/commands/).

```bash
rolypoly  <COMMAND> [ARGS]...
```

If you have suggestions for additional commands or features, or want to implement some of these - please let us know, and consider contributing :-) 

## Dependencies

Not all 3rd party software is used by all the different commands. RolyPoly includes a "citation reminder" that will try to list all the external software used by a command. The "reminded citations" are pretty printed to console (stdout) and to a logfile. To shut off the terminal citation reminder printing, set `ROLYPOLY_REMIND_CITATIONS` to false in your `rpconfig.json` file.

## Motivation
There are many good virus analysis tools out there*. Many of them are custom made for specific virus groups, some are generalists, but most require complete control over the analysis process (so one or two points of entry for data). Apart from input requirements, these pipelines vary in implementation (language, workflow management system (snakemake, nextflow...), dependencies), methodologies (tool choice for a similar step such as assembly), and goals (e.g. specific pathogen analysis vs whole virome analysis). These differences affect design and tooling choices (such as selecting a fast nucleotide-based sequence search method limited to high identity, over a slower but more sensitive profile- or structure-based (amino acid) search method). This has created some "lock in" (IMO), and I have found myself asked by people "what do you recommend for xyz" or "which pipeline should I use". Most people have limited time to invest in custom analysis pipeline design and so end up opting for an existing, off-the-shelf option, potentially compromising or having to align their goals with what the given software offers (if they are already aligned - great!).
